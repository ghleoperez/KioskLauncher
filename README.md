# KIOSK Mode Example

This is an example code for Android **KIOSK mode** in Java

### Dedicated device features

Android includes APIs to help people using dedicated devices focus on their tasks. You typically call these APIs from a custom home app that you develop. Your custom home app can use some, or all, of the following APIs:

 - Run the system in an immersive, kiosk-like fashion where devices are locked to a whitelisted set of apps using lock task mode.
 - Share a device between multiple users (such as shift workers or public-kiosk users) by managing ephemeral and secondary users.
 - Avoid devices downloading the same app again for each temporary user by caching app packages.
 - Suspend over-the-air (OTA) system updates over critical periods by freezing the operating system version.
 - To call these APIs, apps need to be the admin of a fully managed deviceâ€”explained in the following section.
